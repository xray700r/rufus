Enhancements/Bugs
-----------------

Please use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/issues)
for reporting problems or suggesting new features.
* A request was made to add to the languages fully supported. The original author [rejected Albanian language](https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/pull/1334) for several reasons listed by himself in the pull request rejection (most importantly having more than 30 languages to care about). 
* The project was then forked and the needed translation added. 
* This repo is not officially supported by the original Rufus author but will be available to everyone who wants to have the GUI translated in Albanian.
